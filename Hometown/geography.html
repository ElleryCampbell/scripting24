                <h3>OPPORTUNITY</h3>
                <p>In the winter of 1025 YK, world leaders came together and formed a united republic under the name
                    Opportunity, where the world had a chance to grow together. What once were nations were now city
                    states under the same banner. And then on, the problems of the world were solved in unison.
                    Opportunity was quickly sprung into a golden age of enlightenment and innovation.</p>

                <h4>History of the Terrain</h4>
                <p>Before "The Last War" ended in 994YK, many took advantage of the conflict between Cyre and Valanar to
                    carry out their own pofitable plots. Breland, the banner that once claimed the land Free City is now
                    built on, began creating warforged for battle. Utilizing the souls of those left wounded on the
                    battlefield, merging them with the armaments, where they were sapped of their free will and left to
                    serves as nothing more than a power source for for the metal constructs. </p>
                <p> When the war came to and end, the surrounding societies agreed the warforged factories were to be
                    shut down, as the continued creation of them was unethical and in many cases, criminal. This caused
                    Breland to move their operations underground, keeping it hidden from righteous eyes. Free city was
                    built above one of these factories, unknown to President jack, and the original settlers that came
                    with him.</p>

                <h4>The Spike</h4>
                <p> A shard of shining minieral, lodged into the base of the United Peaks by a Colossal giant millennium
                    ago. The narrow 'spike' casts shade over sections of Free City's Sky, the underside of it
                    encompasses the roof of the undercity's cavern. Citizens trapped within the rust and filth look to
                    the spike for its 'false stars', man-made vibrancy of their own sunken city, reflected in the
                    mineral of the spike.</p>
