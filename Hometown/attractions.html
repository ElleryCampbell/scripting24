                <h4>The Spike</h4>
                <p>From passed down records, a millennium ago, colossal giants
                    occupied and waged war along the lands that are now known as
                    Opportunity. It is heavily theorized that during that fight among them that
                    one particular giant removed a large spike that originated from the United
                    Peaks and impaled into the ground as an improvised attack, creating a
                    large protrusion through Eberron's crust. Since then, the spike still stands
                    and now covers Free City in a shade.</p>

                <h4>United Peaks</h4>
                <p>A mountainous terrain that borders the peninsula that Free
                    City occupies. It is home to the eighth largest mountain in the world, Mt.
                    Lanshire. While mountainous terrains tend to be cold, the United Peaks is
                    built very sporadically with crevices that allowed warmer enclosures. One
                    large said enclosure became home to the United Peaks Bird Sanctuary that
                    was part of the Erhaltung 1026 Act to preserve species before their
                    endangerment. It was overturned in 1032 YK by the Free City advisory
                    board.</p>

                <h4>Project Image</h4>
                <p>A famed theater created by Jacqueline in hopes to bring her
                    love for 'proper' theater back from the modern world she originated from. It
                    had many famed plays from that era with revitalized portions of the play
                    apparently she was not as fond of.</p>

                <h4>War Games Arena</h4>
                <p>Free City is home to the Free City Silverfish. An arena
                    known as the Melody Dome was built in 1022 YK to participate in the
                    traditional games. After its construction and popularity, an entertainment
                    district was built around it, including Project Image.</p>

                <h4>Monument of the Storm.</h4>
                <p>A beheaded brass dragon statue that once existed in the town
                    square of the Undercity. It now lies in ruins and remains one of the only
                    places in the Undercity with any greenery at all, particular flowers that can
                    survive without sunlight. People mistake the dragon as a bronze dragon. This monument was originally built in honour of the brass dragon-kin man that lead the 1029YK uprising. A cause that was thwarted by a some double crossing, and Peacekeepers armed with flamethrowers acting under a plan that would become known as "Morning Storm".</p>
