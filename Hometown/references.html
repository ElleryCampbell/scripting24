            <p>Content - Free City was lovingly crafted by the Game Master of the D&D game I participate in, It serves as Finnik's birth place, and a reminder of what lies behind the viel of "Unity". All credits for the information behind this city belong to the GM Hao!</p>

           <h4>INSPIRATIONS</h4>
           <p>There was plenty of other media that inspired not just free city, but the entire world it rests in. Such as Violet Evergarden, The Legend of Korra, Final Fantasy, and most prominently showcased in Free City, Arcane. With a city split between its wealthy upper half and a writhing community below the surface, it would be hard to miss Arcane's influence on this city's structure. </p>

           <h4>PLAYER EXPERIENCE</h4>
           <p>As for my part in it all, besides the graphics (Dividers and City Crest) for this website, I'm responsible for playing Finnik Vienna Carrion in this campaign, as I've mentioned 10 too many times. Knowing the city was based off Piltover and Zaun, as well as going into the story connected with another player's character who was from the undercity, I thought it would be interesting to involve myself with the Peacekeepers of Free City. It came with all the complications, forbidden knowledge, and control issues I could have hoped for in a character, as well as deepening the complications between me and the other player in the party.</p>
           <p>I've never been part of a story like this before, Hao has gone above and beyond to make this experience unforgettable. He has such a gut wrenching way of understanding what kind of story each of his players are looking for, giving them the tools they need to feel like they're making an impact, and pulling hooks from our backstories to deliver a truely one of a kind experience. Every character he portrays has so many levels, even the one-off goof characters, He has taken the conceptual idea I had for Finnik's backstory and developed it into a fully realized landscape, characters like Finnik's parents became so much more interesting and complex than I would ever have imagined them to be, all while staying within my original vision for them.</p>
