            <h3>Population</h3>
            <p>Free City houses a population of 3.7 million, Though it is rumored that over half of the
                population of the Undercity is unaccounted for. Mainly consisting of 40% Delphi,
                21% human, 9% elves, 30% other. Delphi is the kingdom that takes claim of the
                New World, all races in the New World have been claimed as a Delphi by the First
                World. Free City is the only main location where the Delphi and Eberronians live within the same walls.</p>

            <h4>Free City</h4>
            <p>A wealthy upper end city primarily built with pristine architecture akin
            to Italy in the renaissance era with an added taste of modernization and
            materials readily available such as simple brick and marble. You'll see people
            follow fashion trends and wear overzealous articles of clothing that are made to
            make statements. A very much suit and tie lifestyle can be found here. They attend
            balls, theaters, and criticize world views, and are well protected by the peacekeepers.</p>

            <h4>"The Seam"</h4>
            <p>
                A stretch of city between Free City and drop to the Undercity that was created
                and unofficially proclaimed by the general populace. This made a separation of
                two different cultures and lifestyles
            </p>
            <h4> "The Balcony" </h4>
            <p>Sitting on the far back wall of the cavern that houses the undercity, is an elevated shelf of stone that supports a sub-district for those who have clawed profit from the undercity citizens, in many cases exploiting them more than topside itself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
            <h4>Undercity</h4>
            <p>
                A poor end portion of the city that often is depicted with the aesthetic
                of iodized copper and rusted metals. A common way to differentiate the energy is
                the river that's located on the northern side, littered with trash and toxic waste as
                a byproduct from factories that power both cities. Populace of the Undercity's
                favorite pastime is brawl fights, drinking at pubs, gambling and playing
                recreational War Games. Up until 1052 YK, 32 years after its finding, the
                Undercity has been kept hush hush from the general public of Opportunity.
