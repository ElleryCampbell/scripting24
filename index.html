          <h3> HELLO  :) </h3>

          <p>

            Ellery is a 21 year old student born in Edmonton, and is currently enroled in the Multi-Media Productions
            program at Lethbridge Polytechnic with a focus on art and writing.

            She has worked as a freelance artist for 6 years, doing projects for communities as early as 2016. Going on
            to lead
            creativity-based summer camps and writing for businesses. In her free time, Ellery keeps up with the love of
            skating
            that comes from a youth full of hockey tournaments and a liking for the cold. Ellery also works on her own
            personal
            creative pursuits, learning violin, running a home game of Dungeons and Dragons for her friends, as well as
            working
            on a comic by the name of 'Clipped Wings'. Inspiration for Ellery has always come from her best friend.
            They've been beside each other for over 10 years, and
            have leapt through different art, movie, and music communities together. Her best friend will always be
            considered
            her muse as they continue to tell stories together to this day.

    <div class="container-fluid py-5">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>CATS</h3>
          <p> I didn't want 4 cats but I love them all dearly. My first cat was Charlie, a medium hair ginger, she's
            kinda mean to me but its part of her charm. We then got Karma, the chunky tourtiseshell, and only had her
            for 18 months before she slipped out of the house, leading us to get Pokie, our grey tabby replacement cat,
            who lives up to her name as the slapper of anything in sight. The final addition to the house was Toto, a
            stray polydactal kitten that we found near the hospital! Just when we thought we'd reached our cap at 4
            cats, Karam was found and brought home. Despite the amount of fuzzy guys running around being a heavy
            undertaking, I have more than enough love to go around, and am delighted to have each of them.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>ART</h3>
          <p>Creation and I have a complicated relationship. Like every artist, I'm constantly unhappy with everything I create, but find myself feeling drained and unfulfilled when not creating. Its been a slow journey of learning to love the process, and I'm no where near where I'd like to be, but coming to know how important the act of creating was to me was a huge part of my journey. It started with character art for dumb things like <a href="https://warriorcats.com/" target="_blank">Warrior Cats</a> or cringey-felt inserts, but has evolved into commissions and requests for D&D characters or personal projects. I'm excited to keep disovering inspiration as I continue to first and foremost, treat art as a love letting to my friends, who partake in telling these stories along side me. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>MUSIC</h3>
          <p>Music has served as my greatest inspiration, every character or world I write is backed by a song that started it all, and a playlist of songs to follow it's jounrey. My favourite bands are Mother Mother, Lord Huron, Glass Animals, Half Moon Run, Hozier and Fleetwood Mac, my most recent love and longest love being Mother Mother, they cover a lot of the struggles around loving 'properly', which is something I've always gravitated to when it comes to lyrisism. Music has been a way my family connects to each other, buying and displaying vinyls has been a way we show our love back to the music that keeps us bonded as we listen along at concerts and local music events. I also love the moto of Mother Mother's lead male vocalist, "♡!" meaning love Loud!</p>

              <h3>FINNIK</h3>
              <p> This is a whole section dedicated to a D&D character, which sounds rediculous, but as someone who loves the world of storytelling, I've never cared about a character more than her, and her story is something so profound and responsive to me. Finnik Vienna Carrion, as linked in the fictional character tab, is a Tiefling Fighter/Clockwork Sorcerer, whos story explores the consiquenses of love and lies through a patchy connection with her father. Through playing her I've been able to grapple with themes of Paranoia, a love of birds, and the confusion of connection, all things very close to me. She's pretentious and entitled, and its been so fun to bounce off the personalities of the other players through conflict and comradery. Finnik is a character I look forward to playing, and is the subject of my personal project 'Clipped Wings'.</p>

              <h3>BIRDS</h3>
              <p> I've been boarderline obnoxious about how much I love these stupid creatures, and that will not stop today. I resonate so deeply with birds becuase of the term 'Bird Brain'. I've felt, as it describes "annoyingly stupid or slow" my whole life, I miss a lot of things, and I often feel very absent or detatched. But birds are a lot smarter than we give them credit for, and my favourite bird family, corvids, are well known for their tricky mindset, social bonds and ability to solve complex problems. So maybe I'm less of a 'Bird Brain' and more 'Just smart enough to get by', and I'll continue to apprecate our feathered friends through birding walks, photography, and using their behavious/themes as a story telling inspiration. Here are some of my favourites! Carrion Crows, Magpies, Bluejays, <a href="https://ebird.org/species/stejay" target="_blank">Stellar's Jay</a>, Osprey, <a href="https://ebird.org/species/chwcuc1" target="_blank">Chestnut Winged Cuckoo</a>, and the Chickadee! :) </p>

              <h3>LR&PH</h3>
              <p> Standing for 'Low Rolls & Plot Holes', is the home game of Dungeons & Dragons I've been running for over 5 years now. It's a high fantasy world that follows the actions of Bridget Enya Indris, Senryn Dynn, Vera Willowfern, Ruby Jyemm, and Aviston Limaris, centered around the meddlings of ancient minds and the god eater they wish to bring forth. The party battles to find 10 scattered fragments of a spell to interrupt an the Marcineel Empire's advances in removing magic from the world, telling a story of those who fight for the right to express themselves and uprooting the darker dealings of the world. I've loved being the Dungeon Master for this journey, getting to make supid jokes and roll dice with my friends has quickly become the highlight of my life while I navigate what it takes to tell an actual story. </p>
