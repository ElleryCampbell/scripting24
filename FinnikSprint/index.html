 <h2>♥ ABOUT ♥</h2>

 
    <p>Finnik Vienna Carrion is a tiefling born in Free City and raised alone by her father Captain Kane Carrion of the Free City Peacekeepers. She was trained on the persuit of truth, a trait that became a much deeper issue as her father would continuously refuse to tell Finnik who her mother was. Through undercity missions Finnik met Aeress, a young brass dragonkin girl who would become her eyes and ears for many of the cases Finnik was tasked to solve as a member of the peaceforce.</p>
    <p>After solving a particularly tough case outside the jurisdiction of her station, the tensions in her life all snapped. The Undercity fell to chaos following a factory explosion, causing Aeress to flee the city and Finnik to be arrested by her father for the sake of 'keeping her out of it'. Finnik was rescued from her confinement by a strange tall woman, who welcomed her to the establishment 'Worldly Love' and fed her horrid truths of her fathers work, as well as allowed her to see for herself that Aeress had abandonded her. With so few options left, Finnik chose to stay with Worldly Love. Where she altered her identity, and was tought to harness her inate clockwork abilities with the tall woman, 'Aliana' as her mentor.</p>
    <p>Finnik is caught in a vicious game of rock paper scissors, Aliana would do anything to keep Finnik away from Aeress under the interest of keeping her close to home, Aeress wants deperately to kill her father, Kane for what he'd done to her family, and Kane, Finnik imagines, would stop at nothing to kill Aliana, and return Finnik home. Every person she had an ounce of love for wanted the other dead, and its up to her to figure out who is worth saving.</p>

    <!-----------PERSONALITY-->
    <section id="personality">

    <h2>♥ PERSONALITY ♥</h2>

    <p>Finnik is refined and pretentious, Though a deep kindness still remains in her from her youth spent with Aeress and Kane, that kindness now often goes misused under Aliana's guidance. She wanders the world paranoid that people 'know what she'd done' assuming everyone can see the blood on her hands as she can, leading her to act quietly and cautiously, avoiding recognition by the wrong people. </p>
    <p>She's cold, and tries to appear disconnected above the overwhelming fear at her root.</p>

    <!----------------SKILLS-->
    <section id="skills">
    <h2>♥ SKILLS ♥</h2>
    <p>Finnik has 2 primary abilities she uses in combat, complimented by many other skills gathered through hobby!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Marksman/Sniper.</li>
        <li>Chronomancy caster.</li>
        <li>Chronomanic re-discovery researcher.</li>
        <li>Detective.</li>
        <li>Jeweler.</li>
        <li>Bird Identifier.</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h4>Marksman / Sniper</h4>
    <p>Finnik learned to shoot from her father on camping trips to the United Peaks, and continued her training under him as she became an officer, mostly because he didn't trust anyone else with the task. Finnik found a nack for long range combat, weilding the 'Peregrine Rifle', a weapon that onced belonged to her mother, gifted to her by her father.</p>

    <h4>Chronomancy Caster</h4>
    <p>Chronomancy is a fancy word for time magic, some practitioners of this craft have learned each rune of it mark by mark, while it flows through others innately, seeping into every spell they cast wether they want it do or not. Finnik is the later, known as a 'clockwork soul' these casters are few and far between.</p>

    <h4>Chonomantic re-discovery researcher</h4>
    <p>Time magic has been sticken from the world, leaving factions like Worldly Love to re-trase the steps of history to uncover it once more, though they must do so in secret, since it is the wish of the surrounding authority that Chronomancy never becomes a public resource under any circumstances. Finnik has gone beyond following ancient paths, combining concrete runic patterns and innate limitless abilities, using the runes as anchors and amplifiers to those brimming with time altering powers through tattoos.</p>

    <h4>Detective</h4>
    <p>Before Finnik was picked up by Worldly Love, and was instead living with her father as a peacekeeper, she spent many years in the undercity investigating the seemingly endless strings of crime behind every wall. She picked up most of these skills from her Uncle, and superior officer, Lieutenant Jaxton Dororsh. She continues to use the abilities today, though under her own interests, instead of those of the law.</p>

    <h4>Jeweler</h4>
    <p>When Finnik joined worldly Love, her identity was seen as a problem, bringing Aliana to order her alterations. Finnik's horns and tail were removed completely, while her ears were rounded to a more humanoid shape. This caused Finnik to venture into the art of making jewelery, as she felt shame about the scarred edges, and wished to make ear cuffs for herself. Though Finnik has always loved shiny things, this unfortunate change to her life allowed her fill her free time with understanding the craft.</p>

    <h4>Bird Identifier</h4>
    <p>This isn't particularly a useful skill, though knowing lots about birds once won her a 'how many feathers are on this cockatrice' challenge. Finnik's aunt Zarelli shared a fascination with their feathered friends, allowing Finnik to keep her passion for the small creatures alive, as she had someone equaly delighted by them. Her enjoyment of birds stemmed from her family name 'Carrion', the symbol of her house being the <a href="https://ebird.org/species/carcro1" target="_blank">Carrion Crow</a>. Other associations with birds can be found in her rifle, named after the <a href="https://ebird.org/species/perfal" target="_blank">Peregrine Falcon</a>, as is the bird carved on the stock of the weapon. In her bonded familiar, taking on the appearance of a <a href="https://ebird.org/species/grscuc1" target="_blank">Great Spotted Cuckoo</a>. Even things as small as the horse she rode to the United Peaks Lodge, who was named <a href="https://ebird.org/species/yelcan1" target="_blank">'Canary'</a>.</p>
